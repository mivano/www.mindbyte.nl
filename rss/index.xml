<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creating a password for any site or service is difficult enough, but even more when the password needs to comply to a password policy. Minimum length, number of digits, uppercase and lowercase mixes and non alphabetical characters are favorites. And with a bit of luck it should also not be the same password as used in the last x password resets. Combine that with a password age so the user need to do this excercise every number of days.</p>

<p>What we get is either a technical capable person using a password helper with long random passwords or someone with a <em>complex</em> password used on all sites. When it needs renewal, it normally has a sequential number added to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So creating secure and safe passwords is a challenge for sure. Passwords that look very secure, as in they match the password complexity rules, are actually not secure at all. Take for example <strong>&amp;Password1</strong>, which is of a decent size, has lower and uppercase characters, has a digit and even a non-alphabetical character. Even when we use common words it is quite often the first character which is a uppercase. A <em>e</em> becomes a <em>3</em>, a <em>0</em> for an <em>o</em> etc. Hackers know this so almost all the dictionary attacks have these words and their variations in their list.
Of course making it complex will make it harder to hack, but also harder to remember by the actual user.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although the above example shows that this is easier to remember, it is <a href="http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/2012/proceedings/a7_Shay.pdf">not proven</a> to be.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_direction">Direction</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are seeing more and more that the current approach to password complexity is changing. Microsoft released a nice paper on <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Microsoft_Password_Guidance-1.pdf">password guidance</a>, but also <a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/tig/special-publication-800-63-3">Nist</a> published some excellent guidance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It basically boils down to a couple of points:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Stick with a minimum 8 character password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not allow common passwords.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forgo the character composition mix.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promote the use of multi factor authentication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not force your users to reset passwords periodically.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check and warn users of attack attempts.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_common_passwords">Common passwords</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a pretty interesting one; after a lot of breaches where passwords have been made public, there is now a list of <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-306-million-freely-downloadable-pwned-passwords/">306,259,512 unique passwords</a> which were used in those breaches. It shows that people tend to stick with common and simple passwords.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the first step in your application where a user need to select a password is to check if it is used in a previous breach. Troy Hunt published a list and <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/introducing-306-million-freely-downloadable-pwned-passwords/">some guidance</a> on how to do this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Either download the full file and do this check in your application (more control, no dependency) or use his API (make sure to hash the password before sending).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively there are system like <a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2012/04/zxcvbn-realistic-password-strength-estimation/">Dropbox zxcvbn</a> which will check against patterns, a common list and the amount of time it takes to guess the password. The script will return a value and tip which can be used in a <a href="https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn#usage">password strength meter</a> to the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make sure to also include user specific elements like username, email, fullname etc so the user cannot mix or use them in the password. Same applies to the name of your service/application.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_multi_factor_authentication">Multi factor authentication</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Something you know, something you have and something you are. A password is something you know. Checking a fingerprint or iris is what you are, although this is harder to check. So the something you have is a populair second factor authentication method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the user has a key generator (even a soft one), it is pretty easy to <a href="http://brandonpotter.com/2014/09/07/implementing-free-two-factor-authentication-in-net-using-google-authenticator/">generate One Time Passwords</a>. Other options are SMS or phone delivery (user need to confirm the ownership of the phone) or using email (same as with phone, make sure to confirm the email address is of the user first).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you use the default ASP.NET security framework there is reasonable support on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/security/aspnet-mvc-5-app-with-sms-and-email-two-factor-authentication">how to build this</a> as it is not part of the framework.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_third_parties">Third parties</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider also if you do want to maintain passwords at all. There is a lot of hassle and issues associated with this. Sometimes this is unavoidable, but it might in other cases be an option to leverage other services which can spend more time, money and resources on this area.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For more <strong>business to consumers</strong> markets you can use Facebook, Google, Twitter etc as an authentication provider. If it is more <strong>business to business</strong>, consider to use for example Azure Active Directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Be aware that you do create a dependency and lose control in favor of other benefits you might get. If you want to keep it all in house, make use of <a href="https://identityserver.io/">Identity Server</a> and as such leverage a proven and extensive authentication system. Implementing your own security is always a bad idea :-).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_other_options">Other options</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do you always need passwords? You can also just use tokens and send a link per email to the user when he tries to login in. The <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/how-passwordless-authentication-works/">passwordless authentication</a> is pretty easy. No burden at your side to maintain passwords, do resets, get stuff stolen when there is a breach etc. However you need to trust the delivery mechanism like email and the speed of the delivery. More and more services are offering this next to their normal login as it is less typing and easier for their users, certainly with <a href="https://www.drzon.net/posts/passwordless-login-in-mobile-apps/">mobile applications</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Passwords are hard; hard to remember, hard to make secure. The best intent to make them complex by requiring a mix of character types and lengths does not help. Combined with commonly used words, common replacements and placements and repetative password resets, we make it our users pretty hard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Support password generators (so do <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/the-cobra-effect-that-is-disabling/">not disable clipboard paste</a> in your forms), do not have mandatory password resets and complexity, but do check against common patterns (common words, user specific values, patterns and passwords used in breaches) and keep checking and informing the user afterwards.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Allow for and promote the use of multi factor authentication to add an additional layer of security.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will make your service/application more secure and your users happier!</p>

<p>There are a lot of resources on how to setup Kubernetes on Azure, but they require some prerequisites, so I wanted to make a step by step guide here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The intent is not the explain what Kubernetes is and does, but to get you started quickly. At the end you will have a Kubernetes cluster running in Azure and you can connect to it via your webbrowser.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_install_the_azure_cli">Install the Azure CLI</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Make sure you install the Azure command line interface. Version 2 is the current one which allows you to use the <strong>az</strong> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The instruction depends on the type of operation system, but all the steps are outlined in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli">Microsoft documentation</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m using Windows here, so I could just <a href="https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCliWindows">download</a> the MSI directly. Follow the setup and when done, open a powershell box and type</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell">az</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This should return something like</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="http://mindbyte.nl/images/az.png" alt="az.png">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If it does not, make sure you installed it correctly, have it in your path, reopen a command prompt (to refetch the environment variables).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We first need to login, so issue the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-PowerShell" data-lang="PowerShell">az login</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will point you to a webpage where you fill in the given code and login. When done, it has a connection between your account and the Azure tooling.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_resource_group">Resource group</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will deploy using a resource group, so we first create one using the az group command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-PowerShell" data-lang="PowerShell">az group create --name=kub-rg --location=westeurope</code></pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I call my group <strong>kub-rg</strong> and locate it in west europe. After creation, it will show some details.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_kubernetes">Kubernetes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Installing a Kubernetes cluster works via the same AZ tooling since it allows you to create containers.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-PowerShell" data-lang="PowerShell">az acs create --orchestrator-type=kubernetes --resource-group=kub-rg --name=mivano-kub-cluster --dns-prefix=mivano-kub --generate-ssh-key</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We create an Azure Container Service, using the kubernetes type option. We use our already created resource group and give it a name and dns prefix. This will take some minutes before it completes. A Windows container option is in public preview, but can also be created by specifying the '--windows' option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once completed it will show you an overview.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_kubectl">kubectl</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similar to the Azure CLI, you also have a Kubernetes CLI. You can download this from the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/">Kubernetes</a> site or use the AZ tooling to get it:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-PowerShell" data-lang="PowerShell">az acs kubernetes install-cli</code></pre>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_connect_kubectl">Connect kubectl</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We now need to tell kubectl how to connect to our Kubernetes cluster. Luckily the Azure tooling can handle that for us.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-PowerShell" data-lang="PowerShell">az acs kubernetes get-credentials --resource-group=kub-rg --name=mivano-kub-cluster</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will not return anything, so lets check if we are indeed able to connect.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-PowerShell" data-lang="PowerShell">kubectl get nodes</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should see a list of nodes.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="http://mindbyte.nl/images/kubnodes.png" alt="kubnodes.png">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can now send commands to your Kubernetest cluster running in Azure.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_use_the_dashboard">Use the dashboard</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are a CLI guy, then stop here, but if you want to see a nice dashboard, keep reading. Kubernetes has a UI which you can invoke using the following command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-PowerShell" data-lang="PowerShell">az acs kubernetes browse -g kub-rg -n mivano-kub-cluster</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will start a webserver and opens your browser pointing to your localhost. You will see a nice UI where you can do most of the work.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="http://mindbyte.nl/images/kubui.png" alt="kubui.png">
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_deleting_the_cluster">Deleting the cluster</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remeber that everything you run in Azure cost money, so clean if you are not using it anymore. Since we created a resource group, we can just drop this group to get rid of everything.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-PowerShell" data-lang="PowerShell">az group delete --name kub-rg</code></pre>
</div>

<p>This will take some time to complete.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With some easy tools you can spin up a Kubernetes cluster on Azure and connect it. With the same tooling you can scale you cluster and talk to Kubernetes or invoke the web UI. Lets see in further posts what we can do with this cluster.</p>
